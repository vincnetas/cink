<knot name="Double Figure 8 Loop">
	<description>Structure: The Double Figure 8 Loop is based on the simple Figure 8 knot. 
Uses: The two loops can be used as an improvised seat. It is also useful for equalizing the load on two anchors. In one top-roping technique, the loops are made very unequal. The much larger one is passed around both anchor points. The center of this loop is then secured with a carabiner to the small loop. During rappelling, this ensures a more even distribution of load between the two anchor points. 
Stability: Compared to some of the other double loop knots, e.g., the French Bowline, the Double Loop Figure 8 is stable. It is unlikely to slip so that one loop gets larger at the expense of the other loop.
