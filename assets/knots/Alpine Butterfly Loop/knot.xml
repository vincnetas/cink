<knot name="Alpine Butterfly" style="Lineman's Loop">
	<description>Features: What is now known as the Alpine Butterfly Loop was described twice by Ashley: Lineman's Loop and Harness Loop. It provides a secure loop in the middle of a piece of rope. Load can be safely applied: from the loop to either end of the rope; between the two ends with the loop hanging free; or to the loop with the load spread between the two ends. 
Uses: It is useful anytime a secure loop is required in the middle of a rope. A good example is when a line of hikers wish to hook on along the length of a shared rope or as a possible option for the first part of a Trucker's Hitch. 
Advantages: It is more stable than either the Bowline on a Bight or the Figure 8 Loop - both of which may roll over. Even after a heavy load, the Alpine Butterfly Loop remains reasonably easy to undo. In addition, it teaches the technique for tying the Alpine Butterfly Bend. This familiarity is one of the reasons that we prefer the Alpine Butterfly Bend over the other similar bends such as the Zeppelin, the Hunter's, and the Ashley.
